1.Looking at the backtrace output, which function called syscall?
    usertrap

2.What is the value of p->trapframe->a7 and what does that value represent? (Hint: look user/initcode.S, the first user program xv6 starts.)
    7,exec system call
3.What was the previous mode that the CPU was in?
    machine mode
4.Write down the assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at. Which register corresponds to the variable num?
    lw      a3,0(zero) , a3 

5.Why does the kernel crash? Hint: look at figure 3-3 in the text; is address 0 mapped in the kernel address space? Is that confirmed by the value in scause above? (See description of scause in RISC-V privileged instructions)
    try to address a not mapped mem page
    address 0 is not mapped in the kernel address space
    yes,scause=0xd means load page fault

6.What is the name of the process that was running when the kernel paniced? What is its process id (pid)?
    p->name = initcode  p->pid = 1
